This repository contains all about Heap Data structure, its implementation, its operations like:
  1] Build Heap: TC = O(N) where N = number of Nodes in the heap
  2] Max Heapify: TC = O(logN)
  3] Insert a node in heap
  4] Increase a node's value
  5] Decrease a node's value
  6] Push a value in heap
  7] Pop the maximum value from heap
  8] Heap sort Ascending
