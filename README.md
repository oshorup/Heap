# Heap
### This repository contains all about Heap Data structure, its implementation, its operations like:-
  * Build Heap
  * Max Heapify
  * Insert a node in heap
  * Increase a node's value
  * Decrease a node's value
  * Push a value in heap
  * Pop the maximum value from heap
  * Heap sort Ascending
  * Heap sort Descending
  
And, Time complexity of each operation is also written, that shows why Heap is faster than some other known DS. Hope you will like it. ThanksâœŒ
